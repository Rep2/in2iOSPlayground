IN2 iOS tutorial. Currently in development. 

## Programming languages

Development of native iOS and OS X applications is done using Objective-C and Swift programming languages. Objective-C is somewhat old programming language that was the main language used in almost all Apple projects. Swift, on the other hand, was released just over a year ago, on June 2, 2014. Swift is a multi-paradigm, compiled programming language created to replace Objective-C. With that in mind, it is enough to know that Swift is a much better language and will be used in this tutorial. Later chapters might touch on Swift - Objective-C code compatibility but, thats for another date.
