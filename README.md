IN2 iOS tutorial. Currently in development. Fell free to make improvements!

This starting page contains a brief overview of tutorial focused on introducing developer to iOS development. For complete tutorial sections select from the table below.

If you need help using git feel free to reference this [tutorial] (https://github.com/Tweety-FER/in2ngPlayground/blob/master/README.md).

# Chapter 1: Getting started

## Tools 

This tutorial is written for Swift 1.2, Xcode 6.4 and OS X 10.10. To get the current version of given software use App Store. Search for Xcode and download newest version. If you already have Xcode, update it from "Updates" tab. OS X is also updated from same tab. Swift comes with Xcode so you don't have to worry about that. Note that to complete these steps you will need an Apple ID which is free and can be registered [here](https://appleid.apple.com/).

## Programming languages

Development of native iOS and OS X applications is primarily done using Objective-C and Swift programming languages. Objective-C is somewhat old programming language used in almost all Apple projects. Swift, on the other hand, was released just over a year ago, on June 2, 2014. Swift is a multi-paradigm, compiled programming language created to replace Objective-C. With that in mind, it is enough to know that Swift is a much better language and so will be used in this tutorial. Later chapters might touch on Swift/Objective-C code compatibility but thats for another date.

## Xcode

Xcode is a free integrated development environment (IDE) containing a suite of software development tools developed by Apple for developing software for OS X and iOS. As we are developing native iOS applications, Xcode will be our main tool. The main disadvantage with taking this approach is that we are limited to iOS operating system for running and OS X operating system for building our applications. Still, this approach is wide favored and almost all published apps are developed natively.

So to follow this tutorial you will need Xcode, which requires OS X, which in turn requires Mac computer*.

## Playground

Playground - noun: a place where people will play

Playground is Xcode tool, a place where developer can experiment with code. It is especially useful when getting familiar with a new programming language. The code compiles and is run at write time and errors are easy to notice and correct.
