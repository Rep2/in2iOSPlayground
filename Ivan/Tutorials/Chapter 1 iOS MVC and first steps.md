#Chapter 1: iOS MVC and first steps
This is the start to learn iOS development. Here will you find some guidelines that will help you understand the basics of iOS development. A good start is to head over to [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) and watch a couple of tutorials. The first tutorial you should watch is [Intro to iOS App Development with Swift](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-ios-app-development-with-swift--ud585) . In that tutorial you will learn how to make an app which records sound, and does some changes with it. This is a good start to learn the basics of xcode, do not worry if you think that the sound part is complicated, it is not. The tutorial starts from the beggining so you will see how xCode and the storyboard work. The next tutorial i would suggest you is [UIKit Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/uikit-fundamentals--ud788) , in that you will learn how to connect the elements. A good thing to know, is how to make an allert window apear, for that i suggest you to take a look at [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24022479/how-would-i-create-a-uialertview-in-swift) 
##Task
The best way to learn is to try it yourself. So try to make a view that has two text fields in it and a button. When the user presses the button, an alert windows is presented with the text from the two text fields combined.
