#Chapter 2: App navigation and table view
In the first chapter was the task to create a basic single view application. If you took the whole [UIKit Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/uikit-fundamentals--ud788) tutorial you learnt much more than the basics. And there are the basics off table views explained. The table view is a much used view, and can be used for all sort's of things 

##Task 
Make a two view aplication.Make the first view have three text fields and a button.In the first field the user should write a sentence, in the second the number of rows, and in the third the number of sections. When the button is pressed move to the next view. The next view should be a table view. The table should have rows equal to the number from the first view, and in each row there should be the sentence from the first fild. And ofcourse you should use the section number from the first field too, as the number of sections.
