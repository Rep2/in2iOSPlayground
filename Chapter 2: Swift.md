# Chapter 2: Swift

This chapter introduces developer with programming language Swift. We use Swift for iOS and OS X native application development.

Chapter is divided into four parts: brief [Introduction](https://github.com/Rep2/in2iOSPlayground/blob/master/Chapter%202:%20Swift.md#introduction),  [Basics](https://github.com/Rep2/in2iOSPlayground/blob/master/Chapter%202:%20Swift.md#basics) which introduces developer with Swift and its basic concepts, Advanced which deals with advanced stuff and Finishing Touches which circles this chapter and deals with Swift novelties. Each part is divided into sub parts which come with examples and tasks. I recommend finishing only Basics and going on to Chapter 3. From there tutorials will reference you to this one when needed.

## Introduction

If you are not familiar with [Object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) it would be best to learn the basics before starting this tutorial. Read thru first two wiki chapters. Then take a look at first two chapters of this [tutorial](http://www.raywenderlich.com/81952/intro-object-oriented-design-swift-part-1) which we will later complete.

We will heavily use [The Swift Programming Language](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH3-ID0) book. 

Start with reading [About Swift](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH3-ID0) page.

When done breeze through [wiki introduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)), just first chapter. 

If you are not familiar with terms like [Multi-paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-paradigm_programming_language), [Functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), [Imperative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming), [Static type-checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type-checking) and [Strong and weak typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing) be sure to take a look at them first.


## Basics

Lets start. Open Xcode and create new Playground. You create Playground from File -> New -> Playground. Read [The basics](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID310) and [Costants and variables](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID310) chapters. Test code you learn in Playground.

When done you should be able to answer these questions.

  - What are constants and variables in Swift? How  and why do we use them?
  - What is type annotation? How and why do we use it.
  - What is string interpolation?

Continue with [Integers](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID317) and read up to [Type Aliases](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID327).

  - Name Swift numeric types. 
  - What is type safety and how is it represented in Swift?
  - What is type inference?
  - How do we covert numeric types?

Learn about [Booleans](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID328) and [Tuples](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID329).

  - What is Boolean type? How do we use it?
  - What is Tuple type? How do we use it?

[Optionals](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID330) are somewhat new in programming world so be sure to understand it. 

  - Why optionals?
  - How and when do we use optionals?
  - What is nil?
  - What is forced unwrapping? Show an example.
  - What is optional binding? Show an example.
  - What is implicitly unwrapped optional? Show an example.
  
To conclude this book chapter look at [Assertions](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID335).
