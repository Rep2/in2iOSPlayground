# Chapter 2: Swift

This chapter introduces developer with programming language Swift. We use Swift for iOS and OS X native application development.

Chapter is divided into three parts: [Basics](https://github.com/Rep2/in2iOSPlayground/blob/master/Chapter%202:%20Swift.md#basics) which introduces developer with Swift and its basic concepts, Advanced which deals with advanced stuff and Finishing Touches which circles this chapter and deals with Swift novelties. Each part is divided into sub parts which come with examples and tasks. I recommend finishing only Basics and going on to Chapter 3. From there tutorials will reference you to this one when needed.

## Basics

If you are not familiar with [Object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) it would be best to learn the basics before starting this tutorial. Read thru first two wiki chapters. Then take a look at first two chapters of this [tutorial](http://www.raywenderlich.com/81952/intro-object-oriented-design-swift-part-1) which we will later complete.

### Introduction

This tutorial will heavily use [The Swift Programming Language](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH3-ID0) book. 

Start with reading [About Swift](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH3-ID0) page.

When done breeze through [wiki introduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)), just first chapter. 

If you are not familiar with terms like [Multi-paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-paradigm_programming_language), [Functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), [Imperative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming), [Static type-checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type-checking) and [Strong and weak typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing) be sure to take a look at them first.

### [The Basics]

## Advanced


## Finishing Touches
