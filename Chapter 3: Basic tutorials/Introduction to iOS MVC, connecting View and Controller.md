# Introduction to iOS MVC, connecting View and Controller

Apple extensivly uses Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern in building iOS and OS X applications. If you are not familiar with MVC read this brief [Cocoa Core Competencies article](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/MVC.html). Also take a look at [MVC wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) and if you want read [this longer Apple intro](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/CocoaEncyclopedia/Model-View-Controller/Model-View-Controller.html).
